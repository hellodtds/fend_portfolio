a new relation between order and chaos

Chaos is necessary to new creative ordering.


No one can hope to lead any [team] by standing outside or ignoring the web of relationships through which all work is accomplished.

Work in various fields has led to my new appreciation of the relationship between order and chaos.


Without the partnering of these two great forces, no change or progress is possible.
